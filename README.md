## Cannabis Genomics Data Analysis

This project explores and analyzes the Cannabis genomics dataset available on Google BigQuery public data, leveraging SQL for data mining within a Python environment.

Techniques from statistics, Plotly Express, and database systems are employed to analyze the dataset.

By filtering relevant columns, joining tables, and visualizing data, this project demonstrates how to use SQL and Python to uncover valuable insights into the genetics of Cannabis.
